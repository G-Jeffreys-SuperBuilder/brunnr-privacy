<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Brunnr Educational Enhancement Extension</strong> ("the Extension") provides supplemental "Mastery in a Minute"
instructional videos
for Grade 4 multiplication lessons on MathAcademy. This policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and the rights of
users and schools.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>For Approved School Users Only:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User identification:</strong> Chrome profile email address obtained via Chrome Identity API for access validation and
progress tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Lesson context:</strong> Current lesson ID, lesson number, topic ID, and page URL from MathAcademy.</li>
  <li><strong>Video engagement metrics:</strong> Play, pause, ended events; current playback time, duration, completion percentage;
volume and playback rate settings; fullscreen status.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning performance data:</strong> Quiz attempt results (correct/incorrect), time spent on lessons, completion status,
which specific questions were answered.</li>
  <li><strong>Session information:</strong> Unique session ID generated per browser session, timestamps for all interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Video watch history:</strong> Which videos have been watched to completion (stored locally to prevent re-gating).</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Non-Approved Users:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access check only:</strong> Chrome profile email is checked against our approved users list. If not approved, no further
data is collected and the extension remains inactive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To verify school membership and provide access to educational content.</li>
  <li>To select and display appropriate instructional videos based on lesson content.</li>
  <li>To enforce video watching requirements when students answer questions incorrectly.</li>
  <li>To track learning progress and video effectiveness for educational improvement.</li>
  <li>To prevent re-gating of previously watched videos across sessions.</li>
  <li>To help teachers and administrators understand student engagement and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Transmission</h2>
<p>
<strong>Local Storage:</strong> Video watch history and session data are stored locally in Chrome storage to maintain state across page
loads and sessions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Remote Storage:</strong> Analytics and performance data are transmitted securely over HTTPS to our AWS-hosted backend
infrastructure.

<h2>Data Sharing and Retention</h2>
<p>
We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal data with any third parties outside of the educational institution.
Data is used exclusively for educational purposes within approved school programs.
Analytics data is retained for the duration of the school year for reporting purposes, after which it may be anonymized for aggregate
analysis.
</p>

<h2>Student Data and COPPA / FERPA Compliance</h2>
<p>
This extension is designed for use in K-12 educational settings where the school provides appropriate consent on behalf of students
under the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). All student data is processed in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA).
Student data remains under the control of the educational institution and is used solely for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>Video Gating Mechanism</h2>
<p>
When a student answers a question incorrectly and a relevant remedial video exists, the Extension disables the "Continue" button until
the student watches
at least 95% of the video. This ensures students receive necessary support before progressing. The system remembers watched videos
locally to avoid
unnecessary repetition. Introductory videos at the start of lessons can be skipped at any time.
</p>

<h2>Browser Permissions</h2>
<p>
The Extension requests the minimal permissions necessary to operate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>identity & identity.email</code>: To verify school membership via Chrome profile email</li>
  <li><code>storage</code>: To save video watch history and session data locally</li>
  <li><code>activeTab</code>: To detect MathAcademy lessons and inject videos</li>
  <li><code>https://*.mathacademy.com/*</code>: To modify lesson pages with educational content</li>
  <li><code>AWS/CloudFront domains</code>: To stream videos and send analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>No browsing data from other websites is collected.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
All communications are encrypted via TLS 1.2 or higher. Data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS-managed keys.
Access to stored data is restricted to authorized school personnel and system administrators.
The Extension includes retry logic for failed analytics to ensure no data loss while maintaining user experience.
</p>

<h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear Session Data:</strong> Users can clear all session data through the Extension popup interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip Videos:</strong> Introductory videos can be skipped; remedial videos after incorrect answers must be watched.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Schools or parents may request deletion of student data by contacting us.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Removal:</strong> Schools can remove user access at any time by updating the approved users list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Minimization</h2>
<p>
The Extension only activates on MathAcademy domains and only for approved school users.
For users not on the approved list, the Extension performs a single access check and then remains completely inactive, collecting no
data.
Even for approved users, data is only collected during active lesson sessions.
</p>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>
For questions about this policy, data requests, or to request data deletion:<br />
<strong>contact@brunnr.com</strong><br />
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy as our Extension evolves or legal requirements change.
Material changes will be communicated to partner schools and posted with an updated revision date.
Continued use of the Extension after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
This Extension is intended for use in educational settings with appropriate school consent.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without school authorization.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without proper consent, we will delete that information promptly.
