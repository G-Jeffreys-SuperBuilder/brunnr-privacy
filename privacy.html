<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Brunnr Educational Enhancement Extension</strong> ("the Extension") provides reading comprehension enhancement features
for MathAcademy lessons. This policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and the rights of
users and schools.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User identification:</strong> Chrome profile email address obtained via Chrome Identity API for access validation and
progress tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Lesson context:</strong> Current lesson ID, lesson number, topic ID, and page URL from MathAcademy.</li>
  <li><strong>Reading timer data:</strong> Timer start and completion events; reading time duration calculated based on explanation length;
which timers have been completed.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning performance data:</strong> Question attempt results (correct/incorrect), time spent on lessons, completion status,
which specific questions were answered.</li>
  <li><strong>Session information:</strong> Unique session ID generated per browser session, timestamps for all interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Timer completion history:</strong> Which explanation reading timers have been completed (stored locally to prevent re-gating).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To verify school membership and provide access to enhanced learning features.</li>
  <li>To calculate appropriate reading time based on explanation length (100 words per minute).</li>
  <li>To enforce reading time requirements when students answer questions incorrectly.</li>
  <li>To track learning progress and feature effectiveness for educational improvement.</li>
  <li>To prevent re-gating of previously completed reading timers across sessions.</li>
  <li>To help teachers and administrators understand student engagement and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Transmission</h2>
<p>
<strong>Local Storage:</strong> Timer completion history and session data are stored locally in Chrome storage to maintain state across page
loads and sessions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Remote Storage:</strong> Analytics and performance data are transmitted securely over HTTPS to our AWS-hosted backend
infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing and Retention</h2>
<p>
We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal data with any third parties outside of the educational institution.
Data is used exclusively for educational purposes within approved school programs.
Analytics data is retained for the duration of the school year for reporting purposes, after which it may be anonymized for aggregate
analysis.
</p>

<h2>Student Data and COPPA / FERPA Compliance</h2>
<p>
This extension is designed for use in K-12 educational settings where the school provides appropriate consent on behalf of students
under the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). All student data is processed in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA).
Student data remains under the control of the educational institution and is used solely for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>Reading-Time Gating Mechanism</h2>
<p>
When a student answers a question incorrectly, the Extension temporarily disables the "Continue" button and displays a countdown timer.
The timer duration is calculated based on the explanation's word count at a reading rate of 100 words per minute (minimum 10 seconds).
This ensures students take adequate time to read and understand explanations before progressing. The system remembers completed timers
locally to avoid unnecessary repetition on the same question in future sessions.
</p>

<h2>Browser Permissions</h2>
<p>
The Extension requests the minimal permissions necessary to operate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>identity & identity.email</code>: To verify school membership via Chrome profile email</li>
  <li><code>storage</code>: To save timer completion history and session data locally</li>
  <li><code>activeTab</code>: To detect MathAcademy lessons and implement reading gates</li>
  <li><code>https://*.mathacademy.com/*</code>: To modify lesson pages and control Continue buttons during reading periods</li>
  <li><code>AWS API Gateway domains</code>: To send analytics and validate user access</li>
</ul>
<p>No browsing data from other websites is collected.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
All communications are encrypted via TLS 1.2 or higher. Data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS-managed keys.
Access to stored data is restricted to authorized school personnel and system administrators.
The Extension includes retry logic for failed analytics to ensure no data loss while maintaining user experience.
</p>

<h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear Session Data:</strong> Users can clear all session data through the Extension popup interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Timer Persistence:</strong> Once a reading timer is completed for a specific question, it won't re-gate that question in future sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Schools or parents may request deletion of student data by contacting us.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Removal:</strong> Schools can remove user access at any time by updating the approved users list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Minimization</h2>
<p>
The Extension only activates on MathAcademy domains.
Data is only collected during active lesson sessions.
Non-approved users experience no modifications to their MathAcademy experience, and no data is collected from them beyond the initial access verification check.
</p>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>
For questions about this policy, data requests, or to request data deletion:<br />
<strong>brunnr@superbuilders.school</strong><br />
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy as our Extension evolves or legal requirements change.
Material changes will be communicated to partner schools and posted with an updated revision date.
Continued use of the Extension after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
This Extension is intended for use in educational settings with appropriate school consent.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without school authorization.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without proper consent, we will delete that information promptly.
